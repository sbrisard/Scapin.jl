    apply_fourier!(ŷ, ℱ, k, x̂) -> ŷ

Apply in-place operator `ℱ` to `x̂` in Fourier space and return the modified array `ŷ`.
More specifically,

    ŷ[:] = ℱ̂(k)⋅x̂,

where `k`, `x̂` and `ŷ` are column vectors: `k` is the vector of spatial
frequencies and `x̂` (resp. `ŷ`) is the Fourier mode of the input (resp. output),
for the spatial frequency `k`. The following must hold

    size(k, 1) == dimensionality(ℱ),
    size(x̂, 1) == size(ℱ, 2),
    size(ŷ, 1) == size(ℱ, 1).

The input vector `x̂` is an array of type `T` or `complex(T)`, where
`T == eltype(ℱ)`. The output vector `ŷ` can always be of type `complex(T)`. When
the Fourier coefficient `ℱ̂(k)` of the operator is real, it might make sense to
allow for `ŷ` to be of type `real(T)`. If this is disallowed, calling this
function should raise an exception.

!!! note "Continuous and discrete operators"

    For continuous operators, `k` would typically be a real-valued vector of wave
    numbers, while for discrete operators, `k` would be a integer-valued vector
    of indices.

!!! danger "Overriding the input vector"

    The present method *must* be implemented in such a way that aliasing `ŷ`
    with `x̂` is permitted. In other words, calling `apply_fourier!(x̂, ℱ, k, x̂)`
    *must* always deliver the correct answer, provided that this operation is
    allowed type-wise (when `x̂` is of type `real(T)`.

"""
    apply_fourier(ℱ, k, x̂)

vector is promoted from `complex(T)`.

"""
    fourier_matrix!(F̂, ℱ, k) -> F̂


Compute in-place the `k`-th mode of `ℱ`, `ℱ̂(k)`, as a matrix `F̂`.

In general, the coefficients of `F̂` should be s of type
`complex(eltype(ℱ))`. However, the Fourier coefficients of the operator ℱ might
be real, in which case, `eltype(F̂) == real(eltype(ℱ))` might be allowed.

!!! note "Performance of the default implementation"

    The default implementation relies on [apply_fourier!](@ref) to build the
    matrix column-by-column. It might be inefficient.
